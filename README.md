Dear Colleagues,

Welcome to this repository, your go-to resource for all the materials you'll need for programming. Should you encounter any issues or have questions, please feel free to reach out via email at "e.rezaei-fard-boosari@uw.edu.pl."

Our first sample file is a comprehensive guide covering the basic functions related to a single qubit.

Moreover, you have access to two convenient online platforms for Python and Qiskit, eliminating the need for local installations:
